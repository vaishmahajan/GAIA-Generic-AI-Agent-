# Generic Artificial Intelligent Agent (GAIA) Using IoT and Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of a Generic Artificial Intelligent Agent (GAIA) face detection system that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) and Deep Learning techniques. The core motivation is to create a scalable and versatile AI agent capable of adapting to various environments, addressing the limitations of specialized AI systems.

GAIA's primary application is to serve as a proactive security and conversational agent, primarily for office or campus environments, by performing staff face detection and behavior tracking.

Developed an AI-powered office security system with facial recognition, motion-detecting ultrasonic sensors, and automated email alerts. Real-time visitor logging implemented; NLP chatbot planned. Only authorization file uploaded. For remaining files, contact: vaishnavimahajan642003@gmail.com.

## Key Features and Functionality
GAIA provides a comprehensive solution for automated surveillance and interaction:

1. **Facial Recognition for Authentication**: Swiftly authenticates individuals entering a restricted area using advanced facial recognition algorithms.  
2. **Unauthorized Entry Logging**: Captures and securely stores images of unauthorized persons on a server for subsequent review, maintaining a comprehensive log.  
3. **Intelligent Visitor Interaction**: Using NLP and machine learning, GAIA can converse with visitors, address queries, provide information, and guide them to the right personnel.  
4. **Staff Behavior Management**: Detects and recognizes staff faces and updates their behavior/status automatically.  
5. **Real-time Capabilities**: Executes real-time facial detection, recognition, identification, and incident reporting.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to design and develop a generic AI agent face detection system from a large-scale image dataset, utilizing IoT and deep learning techniques. The large dataset significantly enhances accuracy and reliability.

## Technical Implementation

### Proposed Work Architecture
The system architecture focuses on face detection administration using optimization algorithms:

1. **Face Detection and Storage**: Detects staff faces using a camera and stores the data on a hard drive.  
2. **Training Module**: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and selection, storing features in a training database.  
3. **Recognition and Recommendation**: Maps test features against the training dataset, generating similarity weights to identify staff.  
4. **Behavior Update**: Automatically updates the behavior status for respective staff members.

**Deep Learning Techniques Used:**  
- CNN for training and testing  
- Euclidean distance for optimization
